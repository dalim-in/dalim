title: Introduction
description: Dalim is a modern, flexible design system and code distribution toolkit. It works with your favorite frameworks and AI workflows. Open Source. Open Code.

**This is not just a component library. It is how you design and scale your own system.**

Traditional libraries give you prebuilt components, but they often break down when you need to adapt them to your brand, add missing functionality, or integrate with advanced workflows. **You end up forcing overrides, duplicating patterns, or mixing tools that don’t fit together.**

Dalim solves this by giving you a foundation to **design, build, and share** consistent components with ease. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open Code:** The component code is transparent and modifiable.
- **Composition:** A unified API that makes components predictable and extendable.
- **Distribution:** A schema and CLI for sharing and installing design systems.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Clean, minimal styles that look great immediately.
- **AI-Ready:** Structured code for LLMs to understand, improve, and extend.

## Open Code

Dalim provides you with the actual component code, not locked packages. You control every layer, from styling to logic. This enables:

- **Transparency:** No hidden complexity — you see and own the code.
- **Customization:** Change, extend, or refine components without hacks.
- **AI Integration:** Dalim’s open structure makes it easy for AI tools to analyze and suggest improvements.

_In most libraries, editing a button’s behavior means hacks and overrides. With Dalim, you directly edit the code, so it fits your needs perfectly._

        Dalim follows a layered architecture. The base layer is powered by
        stable dependencies (like Radix or native APIs), which you can update
        independently.

        The top layer — your design system — is always open for modification.
        This means you can keep customizing without losing compatibility.

## Composition

Every Dalim component follows a composable structure. **If a component doesn’t exist, we create it, make it composable, and align it with your system.**

_A consistent API means no re-learning for every new piece. Your team — and even AI assistants — always know how components behave._

## Distribution

Dalim is also a **distribution toolkit** for design systems. It defines a schema and provides CLI utilities to make components reusable across projects.

- **Schema:** A flat-file structure defining dependencies, props, and usage.
- **CLI:** Install, share, or sync your design system across multiple projects with ease.

_This schema can even guide AI in generating new components that match your existing system._

## Beautiful Defaults

Dalim ships with a curated set of components styled to look clean and professional out of the box:

- **Ready to Use:** Get a polished look instantly without extra setup.
- **Unified Aesthetic:** Every component aligns with the system’s design rules.
- **Simple to Extend:** When you need changes, you can easily refine the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The structure of Dalim is designed for AI-native workflows. Open code and predictable APIs make it easy for AI to read, refactor, and extend your design system.

_An AI can understand your system, suggest improvements, and even generate new components that seamlessly integrate with your design rules._
