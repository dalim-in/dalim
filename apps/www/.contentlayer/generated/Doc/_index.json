      "raw": "\n**Dalim Icons** is a beautifully crafted, open-source icon library designed to complement modern web applications with clarity and consistency. Built with a focus on developer experience and visual harmony, each icon is optimized for use with React and Tailwind CSS.\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n- **Over 1,000+ Icons**: A wide variety of interface, media, e-commerce, system, and utility icons.\n- **React-Ready Components**: Use icons directly in your React apps with tree-shakable imports.\n- **Consistent Design System**: All icons follow a unified grid and stroke style for visual coherence.\n- **Dark Mode Friendly**: Designed to look great on both light and dark backgrounds.\n- **Customizable**: Easily adjust size, color, stroke width with Tailwind or inline props.\n\n## What is Dalim Icons?\n\n**Dalim Icons** is a modern, open-source icon library designed to support clean, scalable UI development. It provides a large collection of vector (SVG) icons tailored for design systems, dashboards, admin panels, and web interfaces. The library aims to make it easy for developers and designers to integrate beautiful, customizable icons into their projects — with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.\n\n## Available Icons\n\nDalim Icons features a wide range of carefully designed symbols, covering UI controls, system states, media, communication, files, and more. Each icon follows a consistent grid and stroke style to ensure visual harmony across your interface.\n\nWhether you're building a dashboard, landing page, or internal tool, you'll find icons that suit your use case. And if you’re missing an icon, contributions are welcome through the open-source repository.\n\n## Consistent Design Language\n\nEvery icon in the Dalim Icons library is built on a 24x24 grid with consistent stroke widths and spacing. This ensures icons look balanced and readable at various sizes, from small buttons to large feature banners.\n\nThe design language prioritizes clarity, recognizability, and simplicity — making the icons instantly understandable to users across contexts.\n\n## Performance & Optimization\n\nDalim Icons are shipped as React components, making them easy to use and optimize in modern frameworks like Next.js. Thanks to component-level tree-shaking, you only bundle the icons you import — keeping your final bundle size lean and efficient.\n\nThe underlying SVGs are also optimized to reduce file size without compromising quality, ensuring fast load times and smooth performance across all devices.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nIcons enhance visual communication, but not everyone can perceive or understand them equally. Dalim Icons supports best practices for accessibility — like using `aria-hidden`, `title`, or `aria-label` attributes — to make sure your UI is inclusive for all users, including those using screen readers.\n\n## Official Package\n\nDalim Icons provides a React component package optimized for Tailwind CSS and utility-first workflows. It is designed to work out of the box in:\n\n- React & Next.js  \n- Vite & CRA  \n- Tailwind CSS environments  \n- Component libraries like ShadCN UI  \n\n## Community\n\nDalim Icons is open source and welcomes contributions, feedback, and suggestions. If you have feature requests or want to help expand the library, visit the GitHub repository and join the growing community of designers and developers.\n\n\n \n",
